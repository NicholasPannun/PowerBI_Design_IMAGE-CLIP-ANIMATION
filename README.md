Clip animation is done with a clip-path CSS property that allows you to specify a specific region of an image or any element to display, rather than showing the complete area. It helps to cover up the section you want in many shapes like square, circle, polygon, rectangular, etc.

In this image slider, on the webpage, there is a total of five images but four images are covered up with clip-path and there are slider buttons to show or slide images one by one. When you click on the particular slide button, the image will show up with a clip effect or animation.
